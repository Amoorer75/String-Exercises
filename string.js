//DrEvil
//create a function called DrEvil. It should take a single argument, an amount
//and return '<amount> dollars', except it will add '(pinky)' at the end if 
//the amount is 1 million. For example:
// DrEvil(10): 10 dollars
// DrEvil(1000000): 1000000 dollars (pinky)
// answer below:


 function DrEvil(amount){
     
if (parseInt(amount) === 1000000){
  
    return amount + " dallers" + ' pinky'
}else
if (amount < 1000000){

    return amount + " dallers"
}

}

//Create a function called mixUp
//It should take in two stings, and return the concatenation of the two strings(separated by a space)
//slicing out and swapping the first 2 characters of each. You can assume that the strings are at least 2 characters long. 
//For example:
//mixUp('mix', 'pod'): 'pox mid'
//mixUp('dog', 'dinner'): 'dig donner'
//write answer below 

function mixup(str1,str2){
 let a = str1.slice(0,2)
 let b = str2.slice(0,2)
    return a + str2[2] + " " + b + str1[2] 
}

console.log(mixup("mix", "pod"))





//Create a function called fixStart
//It should take a single argument, a string, and return a version where all occurences of its first
//character have been replaced with '*', except for the character itself. 
//fixstart('babble'): 'ba**le'
//write answer below

function fixStart(str){

    let cha = str.charAt(0)
    let endstr = str.slice(1,str.length)
    let newWord = cha + endstr.replace(cha , "*")

    }
console.log(fixStart("babble"));





//Create a function called verbing. It should take a single argument, a string.
//If it's length is at least 3, it should add 'ing' to its end, unless it already ends in 'ing',
//in which case it should add 'ly' instead. If the string length is less than 3, 
//it should leave it unchanged. For example: 
//verbing('swim'): 'swimming'
//verbing('swimming'): 'swimmingly'
//verbing('go'): 'go'
//write answer below








//Create a function called notBad that takes a single argument, a string
//It should find the first appearance of the substring 'not' and 'bad'
//If the 'bad' follows the 'not', then it should replace the whole 'not'...'bad'
//substring with 'good' and return the result
//If it doesn't find 'not' and 'bad' in the right sequence (or at all), just 
//return the original sentence
//For example
//notBad('This dinner is not that bad!'): 'This dinner is good!'
//notBad('This movie is not so bad!'): 'This movie is good!'
//notBad('This dinner is bad!'): 'This dinner is bad!'
//write answer below
